## Data Visualization Workshop

This is a repository of examples used in the Data Visualization workshop.  In it, there are three versions of the same scatterplot.  One of these is done using the [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) library, one is done using [P5.js](http://p5js.org/), and one is done using [d3](http://d3js.org/).  

The data itself comes from the [Carnegie Museum of Art](http://www.cmoa.org) collection api.
